## Hi there 👋


Penguinsnake is an organisation ran (/made by) by 2 people who make random projects here on github and other sites, recently we now have 5 creators (only 1 is actually on github though).

Projects:
Luxury launcher {A MultiMC fork customised by Penguinsnake}


Encryption Messages {A project made by CreatorLibs for no reason, random project}


Dusk {A programming language written in Python [DECAPRICATED]}
