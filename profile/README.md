## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Penguinsnake** is an organization created and run by two passionate individuals who love making random projects across GitHub and other platforms. Recently, we've grown to include five creators (although only one is currently active on GitHub).
Projects

* Plugin Shell
  - Ever wanted to manually install bloatware? Well this is for you as with this program, you can just install plugins (which could be ANYTHING)
  - For developers interested: check out the [global-plugin-list](https://github.com/Faked2378/global-plugin-list) for both plugins made by CreatorLibs and to be able to pull request into the list for public addons!

* Encryption Messages
  - A random encryption project made by CreatorLibsâ€”just for fun!

* Dusk
  - A programming language written in Python. [DEPRECATED]
