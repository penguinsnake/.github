## Hi there 👋

**Penguinsnake 🐧🐍** is an organization created and run by two passionate individuals who love making random projects across GitHub and other platforms (of which 1 is only on github).


Projects:

* [Plugin Shell](https://github.com/penguinsnake/Plugin-Shell)
  - Ever wanted to manually install bloatware? Well this is for you as with this program, you can just install plugins (which could be ANYTHING)
  - For developers interested: check out the [global-plugin-list](https://github.com/programming-artist-py/global-plugin-list) for both plugins made by CreatorLibs and to be able to pull request into the list for public addons!

* [Encryption Messages](https://github.com/penguinsnake/Encryption-Messages)
  - A random encryption project made by CreatorLibs—just for fun!

* [Dusk](https://github.com/penguinsnake/dusk-Fakedrift)
  - A programming language written in Python. [DEPRECATED]
